In order to change the program so that it will always follow the valid code branch, I wanted to change the command:
jnz short loc_80486E4
to:
jmp short loc_80486E4

The above command is located in the 0x6CB offset of the binary, it its value is 75 (the opcode of jnz). Therefore, I changed the value in this offset to 235, which is the opcode of jmp.
