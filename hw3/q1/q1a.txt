Code overview:
1. The msgcheck program receives a message as an input.
2. It takes the first byte of the message as the number of iterations we will preform in step 4.
3. It saves the second byte of the message to the end of the program.
4. Loop #firstByte times and preform: a = xor(a, currByte) from the third byte to the #firstByte+2 byte. Here a is initialized to 0xF7 in hex (247 in decimal).
5. If the final value of a (after the loop) equals to the second byte we saved in step 3, the message is valid. Otherwise, the message is invalid.

In the python program I have implemented the code above.

Edge cases:
If #firstByte > len(msg) -> xor a with 0.
If read fails, print error message and exit.
