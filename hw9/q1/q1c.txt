Similarly what we saw in lecture 9, we can send to the firewall many SYN packets, with spoofed source ip and from different source ports (perform SYN Flooding).
This can cause DoS attack since we'll receive half-open connections state maintaind by the OS until timeout on the FW side and therefore requests from legitimate clients will deny.
