As described in the documentation of EVP_DecodeBlock, the function decodes block of characters of base 64 data contained in the input buffer (which is the encoded_password) and store the result in the output buffer (which is *buff[11]). Both buff and hash are of size 65, and since we define buff right after hash, we need to pass a message that will be greater than 65 + 65, because after we will fill out buff, the next address will be the first index in hash, and we'll need to fill it to untill we'll reach the end of this buffer too. Therefore, I passed a message of size 150 and received segmentation fault.
