Using gdb and the core file created after running q1a.py, I found out that we write 135 bytes to the buffer until we receive the segmentation fault. 
Now, as we learned in lecture 5, in order to open the shell using the return-to-libc technique we need to pass password that will contain: 
offset (135 bytes)  -> system_address -> return_after_system_address -> /bin/sh address
Since the program is allowed to crash after exiting the shell, I passed system_sddress again as the return_after_system_address.
