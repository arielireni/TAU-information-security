In payload_for_getting_antivirus_pid() I returned "pidof antivirus" in bytes.
The command pidof <name> returns the pid of the process with the name passed as input. If the process wasn't found the output will be empty.
Therefore the only thing to do in order to extract the pid is to convert it to int.
