In order to pass the validation function, I passed the same arguments as passed in the example.
Then, since Bob isn't familiar with JSON, he searches the string 'command': 'something' in the data. 
So in order to pass the validation and also make Bob print hacked, I passed in the beginning of the JSON a key named bob, which contains a key 'command' and value 'echo hacked'. 
Since Bob isn't aware of the structure of the JSON he will find this string first, and alice will return that the command and signature from the beginning are valid.
