Similarly to what we have done in class:
In the sudo program we initialize buff argument of size 65.
Later in the program, we define the first 10 charachter of the buffer and then concat the password which passed to the program as an input to the the buffer.
Therefore, if we will pass password of length > 55 we will receive a core dump, just like we saw in class.
In my solution I used the password:
AAAAA...NNNNNOOOOO 
(length 75) and hence it caused a core dump as we expected.
